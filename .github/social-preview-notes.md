# Social Preview Image Guidelines

When creating a social preview image for GitHub, use the following specifications:

## Dimensions
- Recommended size: 1280×640px
- Aspect ratio: 2:1

## Content for the image
- Title: "Laravel Cookie Consent"
- Subtitle: "GDPR-compliant cookie management for Laravel 11 & 12"
- Visual elements:
  - Laravel logo
  - Cookie icon
  - GDPR/privacy shield icon
  - Simple, clean design with your brand colors

## Where to set it
In GitHub, go to your repository → Settings → Social preview
Upload the custom image you've created based on these guidelines.

This image will be displayed when your repository is shared on social media platforms and in GitHub search results, significantly improving visibility.
