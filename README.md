## ‚ú® Highlights

- **Zero external dependencies** - No Livewire, no Filament, no JS frameworks
- **Alpine.js & Vanilla JS** - Uses Alpine.js that comes with Laravel
- **GDPR-compliant** - Legally sound implementation with opt-in for all cookie types
- **Multilingual** - German, English, Spanish and Chinese included
- **Google Analytics Integration** - Dynamic loading and removal of GA scripts
- **Locale Cookie Management** - Stores language preferences only with consent
- **Blade Components** - Easy integration into existing Laravel applications
- **Tailwind CSS** - Elegant, customizable design (optional)
- **Mobile-First** - Fully responsive for all devices

## üíª Requirements

- **Laravel**: Version 11.x required - [Laravel Installation](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/installation)
- **Tailwind CSS**: Version 3.x recommended - [Tailwind CSS for Laravel](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/laravel)
- **Alpine.js**: Version 3.x recommended (included with Laravel 11) - [Alpine.js Documentation](https://alpinejs.dev/)

Laravel 11 includes Alpine.js by default, so no additional installation is needed for this dependency. Tailwind CSS is recommended but not strictly required - the component will still work with your own CSS, but you'll need to modify the published views to match your styling framework.

### Checking Your Installed Versions

Use these commands to verify your installed versions:

```bash
# Check Laravel version
php artisan --version

# Check Tailwind CSS version (if installed via npm)
npx tailwindcss --version

# Check Alpine.js version
# For Laravel 11, inspect the package.json file or check the browser console:
cat package.json | grep alpine
# or in browser console on a page with Alpine.js:
console.log(Alpine.version)
```

## üß† How It Works

This plugin provides a lightweight, GDPR-compliant cookie consent system for Laravel 11 - fully implemented with Blade, Alpine.js, and vanilla JavaScript. It works without Livewire, Inertia, or external dependencies.

### üá™üá∫ GDPR Compliance

The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and similar privacy laws worldwide require explicit user consent before storing non-essential cookies. This package implements a fully compliant solution that:

- Blocks all non-essential cookies by default
- Provides clear opt-in choices for different cookie categories
- Allows users to change their preferences at any time
- Properly documents consent for compliance purposes

### üåê Google Analytics Integration

- The plugin blocks any connection to Google Analytics by default
- Only when a user explicitly consents to the "Analytics" category, the GA script (gtag.js) is dynamically inserted into the `<head>`
- Website owners only need to enter their Google Tag ID (G-XXXXXXXXXX) - no additional customization required

### üö´ Tracking Prevention When Declined

- When analytics consent is declined, the GA script is not loaded
- Additionally, the plugin attempts to delete all typical GA cookies, including:
  - _ga, _gid, _gat_*
  - __ga*, __gads
- Even if some cookies cannot be fully deleted for technical reasons (e.g., HttpOnly), no tracking will occur as the JavaScript is not loaded

**Result**: Google has no access to user interactions unless consent is given.

### üá™üá∏ Personal Preferences

The plugin currently stores a single preference: the language setting (locale).
- The language is automatically read from the `<html lang="...">` attribute
- When the user consents to the preferences category, a `locale=xx` cookie is set (e.g., `locale=en`), which Laravel can use for automatic language switching
- If consent is revoked, the locale cookie is deleted

### üîß Technical Implementation

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| UI / Modals | Blade + Tailwind |
| Logic | Alpine.js (x-data) |
| Consent Storage | localStorage |
| Cookie Handling | JavaScript (document.cookie) |
| Language Detection | document.documentElement.lang |
| GA Activation | document.createElement('script') |
| GA Blocking | No script inclusion + Cookie deletion |

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
composer require martin-schenk/laravel-cookie-consent
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="MartinSchenk\CookieConsent\CookieConsentServiceProvider"
```

## üîß Configuration

After publishing the package assets, you can configure the cookie consent system in `config/cookie-consent.php`:

```php
// config/cookie-consent.php
return [
    'google_analytics_id' => '',  // Set your Google Analytics ID here (e.g. 'G-XXXXXXXXXX')

    'cookie_names' => [
        'consent' => 'cookieConsent',
        'locale' => 'locale',
    ],

    'cookie_lifetime' => 31536000,  // 1 year in seconds

    'categories' => [
        'essential' => true,  // Always required
        'analytics' => false, // Optional
        'preferences' => false, // Optional
    ],
];
```

You can modify the configuration values directly in the published configuration file:

## üìä Usage

Include the cookie consent component in your main layout file:

```php
<!-- In your layout file -->
<x-cookie-consent::cookie-consent />
```

### Example Integration

Here's how to integrate the cookie consent component in your Laravel layout:

```blade
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', app()->getLocale()) }}">
<head>
    <!-- Your head content... -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your site content... -->

    <!-- Footer with cookie settings link -->
    <footer>
        <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="window.openCookieSettings()">Cookie Settings</a>
    </footer>

    <!-- Cookie Consent Component (Place before closing body tag) -->
    <x-cookie-consent::cookie-consent />
</body>
</html>
```

> **Note**: The cookie consent component should be placed before the closing `</body>` tag to ensure all other elements are loaded first. This provides the best user experience.

## üîó Adding a Cookie Settings Link to Your Footer

An important feature is the ability to reopen the cookie settings menu at any time. Here are different implementation options:

### Option 1: Direct JavaScript Call

```html
<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="window.openCookieSettings()" class="text-gray-400 hover:text-teal-400">
    Cookie Settings
</a>
```

### Option 2: For Complex Layouts (e.g., in a Vue or React component)

```javascript
// Trigger the cookie settings event
document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('open-cookie-settings'));
```

### Option 3: Use as a Blade Component

```php
// In any of your Blade files:
<x-cookie-consent::settings-link class="text-gray-400 hover:text-teal-400" />
```

### Practical Example: Typical Footer Implementation

```php
<!-- Footer with legal links -->
<footer class="bg-gray-800 text-white py-6">
    <div class="container mx-auto">
        <div class="flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-4">
            <a href="{{ route('home') }}" class="text-gray-300 hover:text-white">Home</a>
            <a href="{{ route('imprint') }}" class="text-gray-300 hover:text-white">Imprint</a>
            <a href="{{ route('privacy') }}" class="text-gray-300 hover:text-white">Privacy Policy</a>

            <!-- Cookie Settings Link -->
            <a href="javascript:void(0);"
               onclick="window.openCookieSettings()"
               class="text-gray-300 hover:text-white">
                Cookie Settings
            </a>
        </div>
    </div>
</footer>
```
